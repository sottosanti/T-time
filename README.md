# T-time

I run this on my PC that has Ubuntu 20.04 installed

## About

Getting a tee time at my local golf course has been very hard and annoying. I found myself constantly checking the website to see if any tee times had opened up because they do all the time but it's annoying to have to constantly check so I spent a few days and wrote this program written in C and if you run the script every morning and the program will run every 5 minutes from 11am to midnight checking to see if a tee time has become availabe and if a tee time has become available then a desktop notification will be set letting you know a tee time has become available and what the time is.
